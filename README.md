# Diabetes_prediction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, and it can lead to severe health complications if left untreated. Early diagnosis and timely management of diabetes can significantly reduce the risk of complications, making it crucial to identify people at risk of developing the disease. With the increasing availability of big data and machine learning tools, there is a huge opportunity to leverage these technologies to develop accurate and efficient models for diabetes risk prediction. The main goal of this project is to predict the risk of diabetes in the patient in accordance with medical and lifestyle history by using distributed job processing with the help of Google Cloud Platform and PySpark.

**PROJECT SCOPE:**

•	The main scope of the project is to predict the risk of diabetes in the patient 
•	The prediction is done by analyzing the many factors of the patient based on lifestyle changes and previous health history.
•	We will predict whether the patient has the risk to get diabetes or whether he/she is in the stage of getting prediabetes or he/she is affected by diabetes.
